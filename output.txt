5	The towel goes perfectly with the alo mats and kept me grounded in my practice in a hot class that I took recently. If you do hot yoga, this towel is a perfect match for the alo mat
5	Perfectly matches my Eclipse mat. Has a very bad smell when first taken out of the bag. You must wash it before first use.
5	Beyond expectations, superior quality and design.

Grip: I am a sweater and enjoy hot yoga. This mat does not budge. No slip (an issue I find with my manduka pro (even post salt treatment).

Color/material: Eclipse (dark blue) is gorgeous and deep enough to mask temporary sweat marks and the inevitable long-term scuffs from a happy practice. Feels and looks a bit more ...Read More

5	Love this towel
5	Perfect towel! When I first unpacked it the surface on the top didn’t feel super non-slip and I was a bit sceptic, but then I brought I to my hot yoga class and it was absolutely perfect. Even with super sweaty hands and feet. The color is cute too, exactly what I expected!

5	Like it so much
5	With your mats, there’s no slippage. I’m a lifelong customer.
5	Fits perfectly on yoga mat and doesn’t slip. Only problem is that the colour runs when you wash it for the first time.

5	Love this towel and how it matches my mat perfectly!
5	So I for 10 years have been using another brand but have to throw out bc it smells. This is not as thick but does not slip. I will have to update in 6 months.
5	This towel is great for hot yoga. This towel is so soft. Shrinks with the first few washes but it’s great. I’ve been raving about it to all my yogi friends. The grip on the bottom helps the towel not move around which is so nice for higher intensity classes.
5	Finally have a hot yoga towel that fits my mat and doesn't slip and slide all over the place.

5	Incredible towel that fits perfectly the warrior mat, and is perfect for bikram: it does not move, and absorbs very well heavy sweat. It dries pretty fast after washing also.
5	I love this beautiful pop of color on my mat, and the way that it really does stay in place with a great texture. No slipping so far, and it’s holding up well in washes. Would buy again!
5	Great quality and lovely color.

5	Fitted to the warrior mat size. Perfect for hot yoga or a sweaty practice when you don’t want too much sweat to seep into your mat. The bottom of this towel really secures on to your mat from yin to power/fusion classes. I wouldn’t be surprised if it works as great for other style mats
5	I love the dimension and the surface
Smells good
Blocks perfectly to the mat
5	Finally decided to upgrade and purchase this mat and it was the best decision. Wish I would’ve done it sooner. Love it especially for hot yoga. The grip is on another level—a towel isn’t necessary. No need to worry about slipping or sliding on my mat.
5	Never had any better. And it is prestanda too....
5	This is a great product very happy with the quality. The thickness is perfect for floor work.
I do not slip during my hot yoga classes.
Color is very pretty.

5	Very pretty, good quality and anti slip, great for home workouts.
5	I exclusively do hot yoga and this mat stayed grippy the entire time! The only critique I have is that the no-slip towel is actually quite slippery, and in the middle of class I had to take it off my mat. Nonetheless, the bundle of the mat, blocks, towel, and mat holder is such a steal considering the quality of these items. I definitely recommend...Read More

It's useful because it doesn't slip easily, and it has lines drawn on it.
The design and color are so cool.
The only flaw is that it is heavy.

5	Help me a lot
5	The non-slip backing is soooooo much better than my other hot yoga towels. It stays put for the entire class. I also love how absorbent it is. The sweat disappears the second it hits the towel. It’s also larger than most hot yoga towels so it will actually cover your mat.

5	I was worried it was going to be your average yoga mat but surprised to see that is not. When I first got it, it smelled weird but it’s thick, and a tad longer than your typical mat
5	I absolutely love it, I use it for at home and for my hot barre classes :) great buy! I love the basic black’ definitely exciting to purchase a fun color too! :)
5	Just amazing
5	I think the idea of a towel the size of a yoga mat is genius! I’m always cold so it’s warmer on my feet and hands and it’s so soft. It is more slippery than just being on the rubber mat, so be careful, but I don’t mind it at all. The no slip side means that it doesn’t get bunched up when I go through different poses. The only thing I would change ...Read More

5	This towel does not slip off. It helped me stay grounded most of the time when I placed it on top of any yoga mats. This is definitely one of the better yoga towels i have tested!
4	I like it a lot! It doesn’t move from the mat but my feet sometimes slip when doing positions like downward dog etc
0	
4	The quality of the towel is amazing, very well made, beautiful color. Took off a star because unfortunately I can't use during regular yoga practice and pilates, I keep slipping from it :( My goal was to find a towel for my hot yoga practices as I sweat a lot, so it works great in the humid environment.
4	I love this mat! However I will say the color was very deceiving. It was not at all what I was expecting, and much more purple than the smoky quartz/pink it showed on the website. Sad that the color wasn’t expected, but happy because I have learned to love this color also!
4	There isn’t a size that is compatible with the long warrior mat. Otherwise it’s just a microfiber towel that almost fits.
4	Good and sticky
4	It’s very comfortable, however when I use it, it easily gets marks on its surface, more than usual for a mat. Most of them go away in the next use, but it doesn’t look really good at the moment you’re using it.

4	Does not stay as well as the one I got with the yoga bundle.
4	I absolutely love the color, Phil, and grip of this Matt. I’ve been practicing with it and it’s amazing. However, there is only one thing that I’m slightly saddened about. When I was in child’s pose my nose connected with the mat and it left an oil mark on the mat that I cannot get off. It seems to mark very easily. It still works really great but...Read More

4	This is a great quality towel. I find myself slipping a bit on the surface, but I think a mat might fix that issue. I also ordered the upgrade set but only got partial set (even tho it was still discounted). Was a weird glitch I think.
4	For some reason I still slip on this towel a bit during my yoga sessions. Great quality though!

4	The mat is cute but very heavy. I can't imagine carrying it to a yoga class post-covid. but it's insanely cute. only thing is i spent so much money on this mat and the alo is already peeling off? I have worked out with it probably 15 times and it is starting to come up. Poor quality letters but a good quality mat.
4	I love the alo yoga towel. The towel is great quality and size for my mat. I bought this is the jungle green and absolutely love the color. My only suggestion is that this towel is slightly more slippery than I thought it would be.
4	I love this mat and I especially love the color. It has lots of cushion and I feel very stable so that my hands won't be slipping. My only complaint is that the light color shows sweat marks. I wish I would have waited to get the newest color that is more like tie-dye. I think it would help disguise the sweaty marks on the mat during a workout.
3	I like the color and feel. Unfortunately I am not able to get enough grip to do many of my yoga moves.
3	Male who sweats a lot. This is already starting to hold the sweaty smell after maybe a month of alternating use. Also the color isn’t very deep. Way more a cornflower blue.

3	Havent used it yet
3	Mat was amazing - heavy but no-slip. Blocks were good buys too.
The towel was very slippery though, I couldn't even do a downward facing dog without my hands and feet both slipping!
Strap is generally ok but you cannot lock the size of it so doesn't really function very well..
3	The quality is very good, the grip and thickness are good but unfortunately the color is a disappointment! I really wanted black and the color is exactly dark gray :/ doesn’t match my gear and not what I was hoping for.
3	Like the color and hand feel, hate the chemical smell.

3	This towel is okay, I really like the quality of the towel. It feels really good on the hands. It also does not hold in odor as much as other towels I've had in the past. I just wish this towel didn't move around as much on the mat during my practice, otherwise it holds me very well and is great for hot yoga. That's why I gave this 3 stars.
3	I thought the quality would be good and then I saw these and it makes me feel like it wasn’t worth it
3	I love the quality and color of this towel. I do yoga outdoors and I got this towel so I could worry less about the dirt on my mat, and just wash my towel instead. No one likes to get their hands dirty when doing yoga...It sticks well, but my hands and feet just slide when doing down dog. With that said, I can't really use it as intended. Curious ...Read More

2	Super cute color and love the contrasting ALO logo, but unfortunately did not stay flat and kept bunching and sliding around during Power Yoga and Hot Yoga
2	The Towel is good but I ordered a black Towel and it looks navy blue
2	Buyer beware this will stain your mat!!! I got this and the honeydew mat and after 2 uses the mat was completely stained black and alo customer support won’t help me. Towel works nicely so I gave it 2 stars but ruining my mat wasn’t planned so not worth it unless you have a dark mat and/or don’t care about staining.
2	the towel slips which kind of makes it useless for hot yoga

2	It's basically grey. Picture is really deceiving
2	Good once you’re really sweaty. Slippery until then.
2	Grip to the map was great and fit my mat well. BIGGEST concern was that the top of the towel was such a smooth material that I kept slipping which made my yoga practice dangerous! Not a good towel.
